Python has a set of built-in math functions, including an extensive math module, that allows you to perform mathematical tasks on numbers.

#The min() and max() functions can be used to find the lowest or highest value in an iterable:

x = min(5,10,25)
y = max(5,10,25)

print(x)
print(y)

#The abs() function returns the absolute (positive) value of the specified number:

j = abs(7.25)
print(j)

#The pow(x, y) function returns the value of x to the power of y (xy).
#Return the value of 4 to the power of 3 (same as 4 * 4 * 4):

e = pow(4, 3)
print(e)

#Python has also a built-in module called math, which extends the list of mathematical functions.

#To use it, you must import the math module:

import math


#when you have imported the math module, you can start using methods and constants of the module.

#The math.sqrt() method for example, returns the square root of a number:

r = math.sqrt(64)
print(r)

#The math.ceil() method rounds a number upwards to its nearest integer, and the math.floor() method rounds a number downwards to its nearest integer, and returns the result:

x = math.ceil(1.4)
y = math.floor(1.4)
print(x) #return 2
print(y) #return 1

#returns the digits to pi
x = math.pi
print(x)
