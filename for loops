#simple for loop ( been knowing how to do this since i started coding fun fact to my future self)
mylist = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
for p in mylist:
    print(p)
    
    #checks for all the even numbers after 2 all the way to the last int/string/float in "p"/whatever name you put it as
for p in mylist:
    #checks for even
    if p % 2 == 0:
        print(p)
        
        #and for else..
for p in mylist:
    if p % 2 == 0:
        print(p)
    else:
        print(f'odd number: {p}')
        #finds all the odd number in "num"
        # so basically it is saying find all the even numbers and display it other/else numbers get stored in
        #odd number:
        
        #basically like this
#1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10 = 55
list_sum = 0

for p in mylist:
    list_sum = list_sum + p

print(list_sum)
#so it basically ads the previuos number to the next number kinda like 1 and then after 1 its 2 then you add it together

#when you do this you get the whole countdown
list_sum = 0

for p in mylist:
    list_sum = list_sum + p

#you can do the same for tuples
tup = (1,2,3)
for item in tup:
    print(item)
    
    #another example
mylist = [(1,2),(3,4),(5,6),(7,8),(9,10)]
#above is a example of a list containing tuples
for item in mylist:
    print(item)
    
    #takes them out of the tuple and puts them in order from 1 to 10
#the thing above is called tuple unpacking which duplicates the structures of the item
#so in this case unpacking the tuples in "mylist"
for (a,b) in mylist:
    print(a)
    print(b)

    
 #(you do not need the parenthesis in "a,b" just makes it look more readable in my opinion)
 
 #when you take out "b" it takes out all the even numbers and leaves the uneven numbers
for (a,b) in mylist:
    print(a)
    
    #when you take out "a" it takes out all the uneven numbers and leaves the even numbers
for (a,b) in mylist:
    print(b)
    
    #another example
mylist = [(1,2,3),(5,6,7),(8,9,10)]
for (a,b,c) in mylist:
    print(a)
    print(b)
    print(c)
    
    #for loops in dictionary
#it only shows the keys 
d = {'k1':1,'k2':2,'k3':3}
for item in d:
    print(item)
    
    #to show the value you need to do this
d = {'k1':1,'k2':2,'k3':3}
for value in d.values():
    print(value)
    
    #keep this in mind if you have a big dictionary then the keys and values will not be in order
#the dictionary above is in order because its a simple and small
